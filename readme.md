Thinspace Plus Text Formatter
=============================

This text format module for ProcessWire CMS “flattens” a text by replacing newline characters (as well as repeated consecutive whitespace characters) with just one space character – and also strips any whitespace or line breaks at the beginning and end of the text.

It extends Netcarver’s original [Thinspace module](https://github.com/netcarver/PW-TextformatterThinspace).
